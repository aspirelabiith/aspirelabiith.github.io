      "Obstacle crossing is an important ability in biped and humanoid robots that are designed to traverse unstructured terrain. We consider the problem of determining the maximum (a) height, (b) width, (c) cross-sectional area, (d) thin vertical barrier height, and (e) square area of the obstacle that an underactuated biped robot with point-feet can cross while walking slowly. Two different biped robot configurations are compared for obstacle crossing: revolute knee and prismatic knee. The path needed to overcome the obstacle without touching it is determined with the help of binary occupancy grid in the sagittal plane and using genetic algorithm based maximization for each of the five cases, considering thin links as well as thick links for the biped robots. The determined collision free path for obstacle crossing is implemented as a trajectory and demonstrated in dynamic simulation in Mujoco simulation environment. In order to control the position of zero moment point (ZMP) and the ground projection of center of mass for stability, a reaction wheel in the torso is utilized. It is observed that increasing the thicknesses of the biped robot links in general has an effect of reducing the maximum size of the obstacle that can be crossed. Further, prismatic knee biped robot performs better than revolute knee biped robot in crossing large obstacles, especially with thick links. Experiments on a prismatic-knee biped robot further validate the results of GA and MuJoCo simulations.",

    abstract:
      "Prismatic-knee biped robots have recently been considered an alternative to revolute-knee biped robots. In this study, we investigate control and stabilization strategies for a three-link biped robot with point feet, actuated at the hip and knee joints, making it an underactuated system. Two architectural configurations are considered: (i) a model with a prismatic knee joint, and (ii) a model with a conventional revolute knee joint. The investigation aims to evaluate and compare how these two knee designs affect the robot’s ability to achieve dynamic stability, especially when subjected to diverse disturbances or non-equilibrium initial configurations. For both the biped robot variants, the work space of the hip joint is systematically sampled to generate a set of disparate initial conditions. These scenarios reflect practical situations where the robot may encounter substantial deviations from its standing equilibrium–such as after a push, slip, or terrain irregularity. The control policy is trained using the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm in a custom Gymnasium environment built with the MuJoCo simulator using default frictional values. The observation space includes ground reaction forces, joint velocities, joint positions, inertia matrix, center of mass velocities.",

The prismatic knee joint allows the robot to adapt to varying terrain and maintain stability during dynamic movements. The design is based on a two-legged walking model, where each leg has a prismatic knee joint and two other joints: hip and ankle are revolute. The control we use is Reinforcement Learning based system that utilizes an Open AI Gym MuJoCo environment and stable-baselines-3 as a tool to train the Biped model. The friction, ground reaction forces, velocity and position are considered as observation space for neural network input.

The results showed that the biped with a prismatic knee joint achieved greater stability.",

    abstract:
      "In quadruped robot locomotion using parallel mechanisms, researchers have used equal link lengths as legs for walking. However, force requirements are not the same in the forward and return strokes. An unsymmetrical parallel mechanism can be considered to accommodate such requirements. This work presents optimized dimensions of a 5R planar parallel mechanism (5R-PPM) with two degrees of freedom (DoF). Optimized dimensions are determined by formulating an optimization problem using kinematics and dynamics equations for the 5R-PPM. Genetic algorithm is considered to obtain solutions for the optimization problem formulated in this study. The constraint condition expressed here for optimization will attempt to minimize the peak torque essential to displace the links in the mechanism for the given height of the robot body and the path to be traced by the end-effector. After analysing all the four possible working modes for the same end-effector movement, the best working mode is selected for the quadruped legs. The equations are formulated and solved in MATLAB, and validated in the MATLAB Simscape Multibody toolbox.",

      "A biped dynamic walker with two legs and two feet capable of walking in double support phase and allowing starting the gait cycle from rest position is proposed. The walker is actuated at the ankle joints alone with no hip actuator, fully actuated in double support phase, and unactuated in single support phase. Assuming a static configuration at the start of each single support phase, fixed point information for the gait cycle at various step lengths is extracted and represented with four parameters of a cubic polynomial. This is used as the end configuration for the position controller’s reference target in the double support phase. Actuation at the ankles considers the unilateral constraints at the front and rear feet. Even with trajectory tracking controller, low cost of transport is achieved by ensuring no negative power inputs during actuation. A proportional feedback controller is employed for cycle convergence, and the stability of gait cycles, disturbance handling, and energetic efficiency for various step lengths is shown through simulations.",

Unactuated pendulum on an actuated cart is a classic example used for designing and testing control algorithms for underactuated systems. While pendulum balancing on a horizontally moving cart is popular and environments available for reinforcement learning, pendulum on vertically moving cart is rarely discussed due to relatively higher difficulty level in balancing it. This paper presents a model environment for a pendulum on a vertically moving cart and trains a neural network controller using reinforcement learning to balance it in vertical position indefinitely without exceeding the displacement limits. Results presented for both con-tinuous and discrete force control input for the cart system show that the neural network controllers can successfully swing up and balance the pendulum.",

We analyze such gaits for local and global stability for a virtual slope and for the cases of completely unpowered or partially powered alternate steps.

      "Ditch crossing is one of the essential capabilities required for a biped robot in disaster management and search and rescue operations. Present work focuses on crossing a wide ditch with landing uncertainties by an under-actuated planar biped robot with five degrees of freedom. We consider a ditch as wide for a robot when the ankle to ankle stretch required to cross it is at least equal to the leg length of the robot. Since locomotion in uncertain environments requires real-time planning, in this paper, we present a new approach for generating real-time joint trajectories using control constraints not explicitly dependent on time, considering impact, dynamic balance, and friction. As part of the approach, we introduce a novel concept called the point of feasibility for bringing the biped robot to complete rest at the end of ditch crossing. We present a study on the influence of initial posture on landing impact and net energy consumption. Through simulations, we found the best initial postures to efficiently cross a wide ditch of width 1.05 m, with less impact and without singularities. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of the proposed approach to cross a wide ditch when the surface friction is not same on both sides of the ditch.",

Joint trajectories were generated using control constraints that depend on the vertical distance traveled by the Center of Mass (CoM) of the biped. For the stance phase, constraints are introduced on the vertical motion of CoM and on the Zero Moment Point (ZMP). ZMP was considered to be at the ankle and the ankle torque was made zero, so that foot angular momentum could be ignored. Constraints in the flight phase are considered such that the CoM moves in a vertical direction. Dynamic analysis of the biped was performed for stance and flight phases and joint angles and velocities were computed. Thus acquired angles and velocities were supplied to a 3DOFsingie leg robot, which jumped vertically to a height of 4cm.",

Behavior of the biped robot for various initial postures is studied considering dynamic balance, friction, and impact in order to find the preferred initial postures considering the net energy consumption and peak power requirements at various joints. Several cases of friction, zero moment point location, and the center of mass height variation are considered in the study. Using the proposed approach, feasible trajectories for an adult sized biped robot could be generated for a wide ditch of 1.05 m width at coefficients of friction as low as 0.2. The results obtained are useful for designing reference trajectories and actuation systems for biped robots that need to cross wide ditches or take large steps.

    abstract:
      "The aim of this research work is to generate feasible motion for a biped robot to dynamically cross a wide ditch which is defined as a ditch with width more than or equal to the leg length. We propose an approach to obtain feasible solutions for dynamically crossing the wide ditch considering the dynamic balance of the biped robot, friction between the robot foot and ground, impact on the foot, limitations on the joint actuator torques and angular velocities. The biped robot is modeled as a seven link planar robot with the ditch crossing task consisting of two single support phases and a double support phase. An algorithm is developed to find the joint trajectories and the joint torques in each phase of ditch crossing by formulating the ditch crossing task as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem. In order to make the algorithm converge fast and to give feasible solutions, additional constraints called Adopted Constraints (ACs) are incorporated into the system of constraints. With time being one of the parameters, the developed algorithm adaptively adjusts the time for crossing a wide ditch. The significance of ground reaction force constraints in obtaining feasible solutions for crossing the wide ditch is shown through simulations. Feasible solutions obtained from simulation results provide not only the feasible joint angle trajectories, but also the joint torques required for the selection of actuators for a biped robot crossing the wide ditch.",

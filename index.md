# ASPIRE Lab
Welcome to the lab website.

The ASPIRE Lab advances the science and engineering of autonomous robotic systems that can perceive, learn, and act intelligently in complex and uncertain environments. Our research covers a broad spectrum of robotic platforms - from swarms of aerial drones to quadruped, biped/humanoid robots, and underwater robots. 

Our work combines principles of conventional control theory with learning-based approaches such as deep reinforcement learning and robot vision to develop systems capable of adaptive, data-driven behavior. Through these efforts, ASPIRE aims to integrate model-based understanding with data-driven intelligence to develop reliable and efficient autonomous systems for exploration, interaction, and real-world operation.
